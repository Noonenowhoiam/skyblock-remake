<b>Skyblock Remake </b> is an open-source fan project inspired by Hypixel's Skyblock. It aims not only to recreate the familiar experience but also to offer a platform for fellow developers to learn and grow.

ðŸš¨ **Disclaimer:** This project is a fan-made recreation of "Hypixel" Skyblock. It is not affiliated with or endorsed by Hypixel or its associated products. All rights and content belong to their respective owners.

## Why This Project Exists

I'm a high school kid, and I really enjoy programming, like you can make anything you want.
I got a taste of that when I started developing this plugin two years ago. It was pretty basic back then, 
but man, did it help me get good at programming, design patterns, efficient code, maths, everything. 
I feel like it would've helped me a lot if there were projects that I could've taken inspiration from, 
so I'm putting this out there so someone on the same path can benefit a lot from this. 
This is my way of paying it back, y'know. Enjoy!
